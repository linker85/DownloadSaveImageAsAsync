Fragment.setRetainInstance():
The Fragment.setRetainInstance() method control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation 
(such as from a configuration change). This can only be used with fragments not in the back stack. If set, the fragment lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated: 
onDestroy() will not be called (but onDetach() still will be, because the fragment is being detached from its current activity).
onCreate(Bundle) will not be called since the fragment is not being re-created.
onAttach(Activity) and onActivityCreated(Bundle) will still be called.

getChildFragmentManager:
Added in API level 17
FragmentManager getChildFragmentManager ()
Return a private FragmentManager for placing and managing Fragments inside of this Fragment.

Thread safe:
Generally, we need to take steps to make sure that different threads don't interact in negative ways:
if one thread is operating on some data or structure, we don't want another thread to simultaneously operate on that same data/structure and corrupt the results;
when Thread A writes to a variable that Thread B accesses, we need to make sure that Thread B will actually see the value written b.
